# rubytunes
Control itunes music playback **the ruby way XD**.
Rubytunes is a just a interface to itunes (with applescript in the middle).

## why?
Ever wanted to control itunes through your *pry* or *terminal window*, without opening itunes window to do it? Well, I did :).

## will it work for me?
I don't know :(. My env is the following:
* OS X version 10.9.1;
* ruby 2.0.0p195.
If you try and it works on different environments, tell me and I will update this README.

## how do I install it? How do I use it? How?
Soon.
